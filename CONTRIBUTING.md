# How to add tests

Go to `[specs.js](https://github.com/syoichi/ncftest/blob/gh-pages/js/specs.js)`. Follow the current structure.

- Don't add the same syntax as CSS 2.1.
- Don't add tests that already exist, just with different values. E.g. if `calc(1px + 2px)` is a testcase, adding `calc(2px + 2px)` won't help.
